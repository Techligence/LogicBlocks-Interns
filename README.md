Logicblocks: A Blockly-Based Application🎮.
Logicblocks is a web application designed to provide a Blockly-based interface for learning and building block-based code. This application is built with ReactJS and integrates Google's Blockly library.

Before starting ensure the following pre-requisites are met, if not you can download them from the link below.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)🐱‍💻
2. [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)🟢 (includes npm by default)

## Getting started🌟

### Which IDE should you choose? 🤔
While you're free to use any IDE that suits your needs, we highly recommend Visual Studio Code 💻. It offers a comprehensive set of features that cater to a wide range of programming languages and tasks. Check it out [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Steps  
1.Clone the Repository: This will download a copy of the code onto your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Techligence/LogicBlocks-Interns.git

#Navigate to the directory
cd LogicBlocks-Interns
```
2. Install dependencies and run a local development server🛠️ 
```
#Install all the dependencies mentioned in the 'package.json' file
npm install

#Start the development server
npm run dev
```
### Troubleshooting🚧

If you encounter any errors, delete the local cloned repository and try again and make sure you have the latest stable versions of Node.js and npm, and try running the commands again.

If that still does not work just write us an email.


## Contributing👩‍💻👨‍💻
### Getting Started with Git🐱‍👤
After installing Git, open your terminal ("Git Bash" for Windows or the terminal for Linux and macOS). Configure Git by executing the following commands:
```
# Set your global username
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your global email
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

# Add the remote directory to your local repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/Techligence/LogicBlocks-Interns.git

# Fetch updates from the main repository
# (Note: Make sure you are on the main branch before updating)
git fetch origin

```
Congratulations, you're all set to contribute to the project! 🎉
### Creating a New Feature Branch

Start by creating a new branch following the naming convention feature/feature-name. ```git checkout {branchname}``` allows to switch between branches.
```
# Create and switch to a new feature branch🌿
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>

# Stage all modified files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"

# Push your changes to the remote repository
git push origin feature/<feature-name>
```

You will be prompted for your GitHub username and password after this.

### Authentication Issues🔒
If you encounter any errors while proceeding, perform the following steps to generate a new personal access token:
1. **Log in to your GitHub account**. 👤
2. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner.
   - Select "Settings." ⚙️
3. **Access Developer Settings**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings." 👨‍💻
4. **Go to Personal Access Tokens**:
   - In the left sidebar again, click on "Personal access tokens."
   - Select "Tokens(Classic)." 🗝️
5. **Generate New Token**: 
   - Click on "Generate new token." ➕
6. **Set a Token Name**: 
   - Enter a descriptive name for your token in the "Note" field. 📝
7. **Set Permissions**: 
   - Under "Scopes," select the permissions your token needs. For general Git operations, "repo," "read:org," "write:org," are usually sufficient. ✅
8. **Create Token**: 
   - Scroll down and click "Generate token." 🟢
9. **Copy Token**: 
   - Copy the generated token and keep it secure. You won't be able to see it again. 🔒
10. **Use Token for Authentication**: 
    - After executing the `git push` command, enter your username as usual. Use the token as your password when prompted. 🛡️
